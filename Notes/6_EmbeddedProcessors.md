# Embedded Processors

## Microcontroller
- Integrates memory on the IC
- is a low-power device (also tend to be low cost and low memory)
- doesn't need to connect to a separate chips for access to ram (already have integrated memory)
- Needs an ALU for logic & calculation

## DSP

## Instruction sets & memory efficiency
